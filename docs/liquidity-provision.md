# Liquidity Provision

## History of Decentralized Sportsbetting Protocols

Many decentralized sportsbetting protocols have attempted to decentralize the *House*, with various implementations such as allowing users to set their own odds (back and lay bets), or creating liquidity pools for various betting Markets, among others. However, these protocols have so far all largely failed to achieve mainstream success for one primary reason: **LOW LIQUIDITY**.

## SNEK Liquidity Provision

Lucky Snake takes a small shift in mindset to create a fundamentally different approach to liquidity provision that solves the *low liquidity problem*. This is done via the **Snek LP Token**.

Suppose there are currently several open *Betting Markets*. A *Betting Market* is an instance of a bettable event, like a basketball game, or a football match, or an MMA fight. Every *Betting Market* has two *Options*, or sides, with its own associated odds, from which bettors may pick one side to win. 

When a user makes a bet, the liquidity for the other side comes from the Snek LP Token. The Snek LP Token acts as a central treasury for all *Betting Markets*. This means that every *Betting Market*, come expiry time, pays out to the winner from the underlying tokens locked inside the Snek LP Token contract. Conversely, all the profits from losing bettors flow back into the Snek LP Token contract.

> Example: Suppose the Snek **sUSDC-LP** Token currently has 1,000,000 USDC locked inside. Suppose also there is currently one open Betting Market: Los Angeles Lakers +6.5 vs. Boston Celtics -6.5. From the current user action so far, there is:
>
> * Aggregate 100,000 USDC placed on Los Angeles Lakers +6.5 at an average -109 American odds.
> * Aggregate 95,000 USDC placed on Boston Celtics -6.5 at an average +100 American odds.

Users may mint Snek LP Tokens by depositing the underlying token associated with the LP token. For example, users deposit USDC into the Snek **sUSDC-LP** Token. Similarly, users can deposit ETH to mint **sETH-LP** tokens, and WBTC to mint **sWBTC-LP** tokens.
